- Certain DVRs generate broken H.264 streams which
  may play with minor artifacts and/or may make the
  player output warnings.
  This is NOT a TaniDVR bug.
  Updating the DVR firmware may (or may not) fix
  this issue.

- TaniDVR assumes having total (admin) access to the DVR resources,
  thus it does not check if the user has the necessary privileges.
  Certain operations may break if a non-admin user is used to log in
  and such user has no access to video monitoring.

- Some (firmware >= 3.x?) DVRs output the video stream as simple MPEG-4
  (referred as "raw H.264" by TaniDVR) instead of using the
  "classic" DHAV container.
  The internal conversion routines to MKV are still incomplete and
  render barely playable video.
  The MPEG-4 stream itself appears to be unstandard and/or broken,
  so while playing directly that (with '-n0' option) may provide
  slight improvement, the resulting video displays with constant hiccups
  and temporary freezes.
