2015-03-09
	Version 1.4.1
	- Fixed login failure bug, which affected
	  certain OSes and prevented access to a DVR/IP camera.
	- Eliminates flood of "Unknown DHAV frame type received: f1"
	  messages, which affected some devices.

2014-12-23
	Version 1.4.0
	- Extensive fixes and changes in the DVR protocol
	  routines, including new workarounds for protocol
	  version-dependent firmware bugs/changes.
	  Some DVRs which did not work,
	  possibly all with >=3.x firmware, will do now.
	- Some DVRs output a simple MPEG stream instead
	  of DHAV. Added partial support for that:
	  videos will play, albeit with some problems.
	- Removed support for channel parameter in
	  dhav2mkv, due to lack of practical use.

2014-09-04
	Version 1.3.0
	- Implemented support for DVR protocol extensions,
	  allowing access to channels beyond the 16th.
	- Workarounded firmware bug in DVRs sending wrong
	  channel ID, some channels were not accessible
	  in certain DVRs.
	- Now checks whether specified channel number is
	  within the valid range of actual target DVR.
	- dhav2mkv no longer requires specifying the
	  channel ('-c' option).
	- Added information to -m0 dump:
	  split screen (available modes).

2013-03-20
	Version 1.2.0
	- Fixed DHAV parser bugs. Improved compatibility with
	  certain devices.
	- Added heuristic aspect-ratio calculation and output to MKV.
	  Aspect-ratio was previously hard-coded to 4:3.
	- Improved heuristic NTSC vs PAL detection for DHAV streams.
	- Debug (compile-time) mode now outputs DHAV headers.
	- Now a warning is issued when unknown DHAV header types
	  are found.
	- Manual network port specification did not work. Fixed.
	- Connection initialization was too sensitive to network
	  latency. Fixed.
	- Added new option: --net-protocol-dialect
	- Added information to -m0 dump:
	  device chipset, wireless alarm and DVR access URL.

2012-07-02
	Version 1.1.0
	- Added standalone dhav2mkv tool, which converts
	  DHAV files/streams to MKV files/streams.
	- Some janitorial work on debug (-DDEBUG) code.
	- Corrupted DHAV streams were not properly resynced, resulting
	  in "No DHAV header. Skipping garbage..." looping forever.
	  Fixed.

2012-03-04
	Version 1.0.0
	- Adopted a multi-process, fully buffered, architecture
	  for stream processing.
	  It is now far, far more robust to DVR/network instabilities.
	  Also robust against local IO load spikes, preventing
	  loss of frames in such cases.
	  Now able to enforce timeouts immediately.
	  Allows a CONTINUOUS local video stream regardless DVR
	  disconnections. Connection breaks are resumed almost
	  instantaneously (provided the DVR/network are still
	  working, otherwise keep retrying). Now it is possible
	  to stream continuous live video for days, months long.
	- Implemented corrupted data detection and recovery
	  for video stream (at container level, not at codec
	  level).
	- Reimplemented timestamp correction routines.
	  Now far more robust, detects and correct most -
	  possibly all - time anomalities present in the video stream,
	  due to DVR bugs.
	- Added support for NTSC video streams with exact 60.0 Hz
	  field rate (not the usual 59.94 Hz).
	  See "-x" option.
	- Fixed MKV output bugs: lack of resolution and
	  frame rate information.
	- MKV output uses micro-second resolution now (it used to
	  be mili-seconds).
	- Added routine for NTSC/PAL detection from the stream
	  data. DVR self-reported system is not used.
	- Reimplemented the keep-alive routine. Now far less
	  aggressive and yet far more effective.
	- Adopted GNU Autotools as build system.
	- TaniDVR did not stop execution is there was an I/O error
	  while writting data (disk error, stdout broken). Fixed.
	- General code reorganization and cleanup.
	- Other minor features/bugfixes.

2011-01-15
	Version 0.0.3
	- Implemented support for sub-channels (auxiliary streams).
	- Implemented DHAV demux and MKV mux properly.
	  Now video frames fragmented across the DVR protocol
	  packets are correctly processed.
	  Frame timing is based on the timestamps provided by
	  the DVR with jitter correction. NTSC timing is correct.
	  Now TaniDVR waits for the first I-frame to come before
	  sending video data (no more initial video garbage
	  which happened in the primary sub-channel).
	  Streams with audio no longer generate corrupted video
	  data (though audio is not currently supported, audio
	  data is simply discarded).
	- Fixed several bugs related to network errors, so now
	  TaniDVR won't simply lockup (or crash) when connection
	  goes down, or when the DVR "decides" to no longer send data.
	- Changed 'keep-alive' to the same method as used
	  by the 'official' DVR client software.
	  Also changed that to a more aggressive timing, so
	  the DVR will not stop responding so often.
	- Network inactivity timeout is reduced,
	  fixed to 30 seconds now.

2011-01-05
	Version 0.0.2
	First public release.
