Some features under more immediate consideration:

- Add support for multi-camera modes (as supported
  by the DVR itself).

- Add timer option for video recording.
  Currently it starts recording and stays like that.



Other missing features (not in the priority list):

- Implement a way to collect the videos stored
  on the DVR, for backup purposes.

- Implement support for camera control (pan/tilt/zoom).
  Perhaps interfacing that with a local generic joystick?

- Suport for audio capture.

- User account management.

- Support for other exoteric features such as firmware
  upgrade.

- Support for voice chat.

- Add DVR clock setup.
  This would allow updating the DVR internal clock
  from an external host, instead of using the DVR's
  own interface or its NTP support.

- Support snapshots (JPEG pictures).
  So we may interface TaniDVR with a webserver
  and be able to check the cameras with a generic
  web browser.
  Nowadays, with HTML5 video, this option is not
  that useful.
